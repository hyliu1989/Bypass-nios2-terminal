# Bypass-nios2-terminal
Communicate with a JTAG-UART instance on Altera FPGA chips. 
It is a example to show how to use Python to wrap the underlying DLL for communication so that there is no need to use `nios2-terminal.exe`.

This is based on the example given at http://alterawiki.com/wiki/High_Speed_Image_Download_Demo.
